# Speech Processing Applications

In this individual project, we were tasked to make two applications that showcase the p5.Speech.js and Meyda library. The first one is an audio CAPTCHA software, and the second one is a music visialisation software.

## Task 1: Audio CAPTCHA Software Using p5.Speech.js 
In this application, we designed a CAPTCHA system that integrates audio playback and speech recognition to validate user responses. Our system includes a randomly generated word from a predefined list of simple, but easy-to-understand words such as ‘computer’ and ‘strawberry’. Each word’s corresponding audio files are processed with various sound effects of randomised parameters, such as low-pass filtering, distortion, and reverb. 

To use the application:
1. click the 'Play CAPTCHA' button and listen to the audio
2. click the 'Check with Voice' button and say the word you heard
3. if you want to have a new word, you can click the 'Generate New Word' button, and repeat steps 1-2.

## Task 2: Music Visualisation Software Using the Meyda and p5.Speech.js Libraries
In this application, we used the Meyda library to extract audio features such as RMS, ZCR and Spectral Flatness from three sound files and visualised them using simple shapes and colours. The music's visualisation will be controlled by the user's voice, in the steps as follows:
1. click PLAY Music button to play/pause the song
2. click 'Change Music Visuals with Voice' and say a colour and/or a shape from the different options (red, green, blue, black, white, circle, square, triangle, pentagon). the application will automatically process the speech and the visualisation will be changed accordingly in a few seconds.

To launch the application:

1. open the 'index.html' file in VSCode or any of your preferred IDE
2. view it in LIVE PREVIEW
3. copy the URL generated in the live preview and paste in your desired browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox is recommended)
4. choose which task you would like to view first, and enjoy!
